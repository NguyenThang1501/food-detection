# Overview
This project aims to develop a program that detects food items in images and provides nutritional recommendations based on the detected foods. The model utilized for object detection is YOLOv8. The dataset used for training the model was self-collected, annotated, and processed by our team. The model was trained on Kaggle with a **training time of 8 hours**.

# Features
**Food Detection**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model to identify various food items in images.

**Nutritional Recommendations**: Based on the detected food items, the system suggests additional nutrients that the user should consider consuming.

**Custom Dataset**: The training data is a custom dataset collected and annotated by our team.
